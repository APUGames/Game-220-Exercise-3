ui-navigate	When user moves from one UI item to another	//	a loud whooshing sound that can be easily looped 	
ui-open	When user opens a sub menu   	Each submenu is shown as a "bag", so something that reads like a bag being opened	// this has a more muddy sound. This mimics the sound of blood to fit the theme, it may or may not be what the game dasigner is going for in terms of direction. 
ui-close	When user exits a sub menu	// A dramatic two attack sound. It substains for a bit and is a very harsh sound to fit the theme 		
ui-equip	When user selects an item for gameplay	// This sound is a short loopable metallic sound. It can be easily repeated if the player were to pick up multiple items at once or go through the different items in the menu		
ui-cancel	When user unequips item		// This similiar to navigate in terms of the way the sound flows. It is easy to loop and has no substain making it nice for a cancel item. 	
ui-error	General purpose error sound. Played when user tries to exit a top level submenu, equip a deactivated item, etc	//	a couple note harsh sound that has little substain.
